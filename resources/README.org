This directory contains resources used by the RSB "web" tool, i.e. the
tool runs a web server which serves the files in this directory (among
other things).

Typically, everything in this directory is included in the tools
binary and served from there. Alternatively, the web tool can serve
this directory form the filesystem. The latter mode is useful for
development since changes to the resource files are picked up
immediately.

The contents of this directory is organized as follows (and served by
the web tool under corresponding URLs):

+ =base.css= ::
     Global style defaults.

+ =index.html= ::
     Start page.

+ =hack.html= ::

     Instructions and download link for modifying the web interface.

+ =images/= ::
     A pool of image resources used by all pages.

+ =lib/= ::
     Third-party libraries are downloaded into this directory at
     build-time.

+ =introspection/= ::
     The introspection "module". Contains HTML, CSS and Javascript
     files that comprise the introspection part of the web interface.
